# Project Details:
  In this project I semantically segment an image of a cheetah into two classes: Background/Foreground by learning the underlying densities of the two classes using the expectation maximization Algorithm. The training dataset is a set of vectors that have discrete cosine transformation applied to them and their elements zig-zagged. I experimented on different amounts of latent variables for the densities of the classes when applying EM which yielded varying results. The optimal amount of components was found to be 2 for each class. 
    Expectation maximization is an algorithm used to find the optimal parameters of a statistical model where the model contains hidden components to them.
