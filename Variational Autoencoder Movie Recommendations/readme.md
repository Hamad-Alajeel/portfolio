# Introduction to Variational Autoencoders:
---
Variational Autoencoders are models which learn latent space representations in lower dimensions of data samples in higher dimensional spaces, by implementing two process in the trianing process: Encoding and Decoding. The ultimate goal of a Variational Autoencoder is to learn the joint distribution of a given dataset $'p_{\theta}(x,z)'$ in order to be able to reconstruct input data samples from a given dataset.
