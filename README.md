## Work Experience

**AI Automation Intern at Revscale Technologies Inc. (June 2025 – August 2025)** 	
-	Designed and automated AI-driven workflows using n8n, integrating webhooks, forms, cron triggers, and LLM nodes to streamline business processes and generate structured data autonomously.
-	Developed and deployed inbound/outbound voice agents with VAPI and n8n tools, enabling automated scheduling through Google Calendar integration, with enhancements that intelligently suggested alternative meeting times to improve customer experience.
-	Built scalable error-handling and reporting systems by consolidating workflow logs into structured Excel/JSON outputs, processing them with Python for key insights, and delivering daily Slack summaries that reduced troubleshooting time across teams.
-	Engineered data pipelines for lead management and customer intelligence, including Zapier-Pinecone integrations for vectorized client responses with deduplication, automated LinkedIn lead prospecting workflows, and weekly campaign performance reports that saved hours of manual work.

**Research Intern at Jacobs School of Engineering (April 2024 – July 2024)**
-	Working with Professor Yang Zheng, programmed large- and small-scale simulations in Julia to experiment with different control strategies for connected autonomous vehicles in a traffic system which included human drivers. 
-	The program simulations formulated the convex optimization problems which generated control strategies for the connected autonomous vehicles presented in research papers and solved them using optimization software.
-	Confirmed results presented in research papers which showed that incorporating connected autonomous vehicles in traffic led to steadier traffic flow, better control of traffic perturbations, and higher steady state velocity for traffic.

**Teaching Assistant (July 2023 - September 2023)**
-	Created interactive visuals using GeoGebra simulating different phenomena in electromagnetics for professor Baghdadchi’s electromagnetics class. Aimed to help students understand the connection between mathematics and physics and generalize the concepts learned in class.
-	Analyzed data on the learning performance of students when novel assessment methods were used in electrical engineering classes. Co-authored a paper which presented findings on students’ improvement in learning. 

## Projects:
-	Using Verilog, designed 3 NPU’s (weight stationary, 2-lane weight stationary, and output stationary) based on the 2D systolic array. Using PyTorch, trained a quantization aware VGGNet16 on CIFAR10 and applied sparsity enhancing techniques such as pruning and L1 weight regularization. Used data (weights, input maps and output maps) from one layer of the VGGNet16 to verify the correctness of the functionality of my NPU designs with Verilog test benches.
- Improved a Variational Autoencoder model’s ability to create novel movie recommendations for users of the Movielens-20M database by applying novel methods of controlling the KL-divergence term in its loss function in Tensorflow.
-	Using Intel Quartus Prime, developed RTL model of a bitcoin hasher along with the accompanying SHA-256 model which implements the cryptographic hashing algorithm required to generate correct signatures to be used in the Bitcoin Blockchain (the model achieved the highest performance metrics in the class).
-	Developed simulations in Julia which confirmed results in a research paper that showed that incorporating connected autonomous vehicles in a traffic system improved the performance of the traffic system.
-	Performed Image Segmentation on a cheetah image by applying discrete cosine transform on features then using the expectation maximization algorithm to learn the optimal parameters of the gaussian densities representing the two classes of foreground/background.
-	Experimented with an LSTM model to predict next day stock prices using adjusted close prices of preceeding week.
