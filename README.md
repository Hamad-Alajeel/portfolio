## Work Experience
**Research Intern at Jacobs School of Engineering (April 2024 – July 2024)**
-	Working with Professor Yang Zheng, programmed large- and small-scale simulations in Julia to experiment with different control strategies for connected autonomous vehicles in a traffic system which included human drivers. 
-	The program simulations formulated the convex optimization problems which generated control strategies for the connected autonomous vehicles presented in research papers and solved them using optimization software.
-	Confirmed results presented in research papers which showed that incorporating connected autonomous vehicles in traffic led to steadier traffic flow, better control of traffic perturbations, and higher steady state velocity for traffic.

**Teaching Assistant (July 2023 - September 2023)**
-	Created interactive visuals using GeoGebra simulating different phenomena in electromagnetics for professor Baghdadchi’s electromagnetics class. Aimed to help students understand the connection between mathematics and physics and generalize the concepts learned in class.
-	Analyzed data on the learning performance of students when novel assessment methods were used in electrical engineering classes. Co-authored a paper which presented findings on students’ improvement in learning. 

## Projects:
-	Using Intel Quartus Prime, developed RTL model of a bitcoin hasher along with the accompanying SHA-256 model which implements the cryptographic hashing algorithm required to generate correct signatures to be used in the Bitcoin Blockchain (the model achieved the highest performance metrics in the class).
-	Developed simulations in Julia which confirmed results in a research paper that showed that incorporating connected autonomous vehicles in a traffic system improved the performance of the traffic system.
-	Performed Image Segmentation on a cheetah image by applying discrete cosine transform on features then using the expectation maximization algorithm to learn the optimal parameters of the gaussian densities representing the two classes of foreground/background.
-	Experimented with an LSTM model to predict next day stock prices using adjusted close prices of preceeding week.
